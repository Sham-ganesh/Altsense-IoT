Day 1
Commands
1.pinMode()-it is used to access the digital pins.
2.digitalWrite()-it is used to control the LED's.
3.delay()-it is used to see the output with  a time delay.
//the parameters is given in micro seconds.//



Day 2
Commands:
1.Serial.begin()-it is used to begin serial communication.(9600 is an optimal speed it is the no of bits transferred per second)
2.Serial.println()-it is used to transfer data from aurdino to laptop.
//the data is  printed on the serial monitor//
3.Serial.available()-it is used to check whether the data is present in arudino or not
//if the value is greater than 1 then the value is present//
4.Serial.read()-it is used to read the data stored in the arudino
//it is always assigned to the character//
Task:
x-9
y-9,10
z-9,10,11



Sensors:
1.lm35-thermister(it is basically a resistor)
-->analogRead(A0)-it detect the temperature of the surronding at gives the value to the arudino in  an anolog form.//multiplied by 0.48 it gives a current temperature in celsius.

2.ldr-it gives the intensity of the surrounding light.
-->analogRead(A1)-here A1 pin is connected and it gives the input to the adruino.
//the given units is illuminance.//
Task




Making micro-controller as a IoT device:
ESP826601-(Expressif is the company manufacturing)
-->3.3 maximum voltage
-->1-3 mb flash memory
-->clock speed 80mhz
-->Internal oscillator.
