Iot is a machine to machine interaction.
1.All the machines are connected to a server(cloud) and it is proccesed according to the requirments.
2.It reduces the human-machine interaction and machines makes decision on its own.

Embeded systems:
Designing a specific hardware and software(known as firmware) to prform a specific task.
-->In embedded systems the software is called as firmware.

Types of embeded system:
1.Small scale-Less real time constraints(not necessary to finish in required time).
example:washing machine extending time for drying.

2.Medium Scale:
Real time constraints is present and it matters(plays a huge role).
example:ps gaming,dvd  player.

3.Large(sophisticated) Scale:
Real time constraints is highly important and complexity is more.


Controller:
it consists of a processor,ram,hard disk which is in built and cannot be expanded.

opposite of controller is processor. 

History of micro controolers:
1.8051
2.PIC-periphereal interface controller.
3.ARM-Advanced Risk Machine
4.**AVR-Advanced Virtual Risk Machine.**-ARDUINO

TASK:

1.CONTROLLING 9,10,11 DIGITAL PINS OF 2 SECONDS OF DELAY(simultaneousuly).
2.9,10,11should blink for 10 times and terminate the program.
3.Control 9,10,11,Leds in void setup().
Note:Run the void setup function as a void loop.

Embedded system communication:
1.Serial communication:
Three major types.
-->UART-Universal Arsynchronous Reciever Transmitter.
	Simplex
	Half duplex
	Full duplex
-->I2C Inter Integrated Chips or Communication.
-->SPI-Serial Periphheral Interface
-->USART-Universal Synchronous Arsynchronous Reciever Transmitter.

2.Parallel communication
