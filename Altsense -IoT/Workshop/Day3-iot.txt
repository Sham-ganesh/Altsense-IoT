Aim:
1.Making arduino as server-controlling from website.
2.Making arduino as client and connecting it to server-sending data from arduino to different server.


Task 1-
Making arduino as server:
-->RingBuffer buf(30)-used to recieve data from the client and procces on it.
-->buf.init();-to intialise the buffer memory.
-->WiFiEspServer server(80)-to make the arduino as server and 80 is the port number through which communication is made.
Step 1:waiting for incoming client-server.available()
Step 2:if client is connected and available then recieveing the data from client using client.read();

Step 3:pushing the data recieved from buffer.
Step 4:Proceesing upon the given data.


Task 2:
Making arduino as client:
Step 1:Note the ip adress of the server and store it in a character array.
Step 2:Connecting to the server using client.connect(server,80);
where 80 is the port number  through which connecction i made.
Step 3:now printing the data in the client server using client.println("");
Step 4:Now stoping the connection between server using client.stop();
